    "description": "MGSfM is an efficient, robust, and scalable global Structure-from-Motion pipeline designed for sequential images captured by multi-camera or single-camera systems. Building on [GLOMAP](https://github.com/colmap/glomap), it takes a COLMAP database as input and outputs a COLMAP-format sparse reconstruction. Compared to GLOMAP, MGSfM delivers faster and more robust translation averaging, with equal or superior reconstruction quality and consume less resident memory.",
