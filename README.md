# MGSfM: Multi-Camera Driven Global Structure-from-Motion
A fast, robust, and scalable global Structure-from-Motion (SfM) pipeline for sequential image collections captured by single- or multi-camera rigs.

## **[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03306)** 


## üìñ Overview

MGSfM builds on [GLOMAP](https://github.com/colmap/glomap) and takes a COLMAP database as input to produce a COLMAP‚Äêcompatible sparse reconstruction. Compared to GLOMAP, MGSfM offers:

* **Hybrid translation averaging:** Hybrid algorithm combining efficiency and robustness for rapid, accurate global translation estimation, while using less resident memory.
* **Supports flexible rigs:** Works with single-camera or multi-camera setups, overlapping or non-overlapping fields of view, panoramic or standard systems.
* **Automates rig calibration:** Requires no prior internal pose information‚Äîhandles both the rig unit and individual camera poses seamlessly.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Installation

1. **Install COLMAP dependencies** using the [COLMAP build guide](https://colmap.github.io/install.html#build-from-source).
2. **Clone and build MGSfM:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/3dv-casia/MGSfM.git
cd MGSfM
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -GNinja
ninja && sudo ninja install
```
**CMake requirement:** MGSfM uses CMake‚Äôs `FetchContent` to automatically download COLMAP & PoseLib, which requires CMake ‚â•‚ÄØ3.28 (as in [GLOMAP](https://github.com/colmap/glomap)).

* **Upgrade CMake:**

  ```bash
  wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.30.1/cmake-3.30.1.tar.gz
  tar xzf cmake-3.30.1.tar.gz && cd cmake-3.30.1
  ./bootstrap && make -j$(nproc) && sudo make install
  ```
* **Or disable automatic fetching and use a self-installed version of COLMAP & PoseLib; this requires CMake ‚â•‚ÄØ3.10:**

  ```bash
  cd build
  cmake .. -DFETCH_COLMAP=OFF -DFETCH_POSELIB=OFF
  ```

### 2. Prepare Your Data

Organize images in subfolders per camera, with matching filenames for each frame:

```
images/
  cam1/img0001.jpg
       /img0002.jpg
  cam2/img0001.jpg
       /img0002.jpg
  ...
```

> **Note**: Only a single rig is supported currently; multi-rig support is planned for a future release.

### 3. Build the COLMAP Database

```bash
colmap feature_extractor \
  --image_path images/ \
  --database_path database.db \
  --ImageReader.single_camera_per_folder 1

colmap sequential_matcher \
  --database_path database.db \
  --SequentialMatching.loop_detection 1 \
  --SequentialMatching.vocab_tree_path vocab_tree.bin
```

### 4. Run MGSfM

```bash
mgsfm multi_mapper \
  --database_path database.db \
  --image_path images/ \
  --output_path output/
```

Use `mgsfm multi_mapper -h` for full CLI details.

### 5. Demo
Run the provided demo on an ETH3D rig dataset:
```bash
cd MGSfM
mkdir -p data
wget -P data/ https://www.eth3d.net/data/terrains_rig_undistorted.7z
7z x data/terrains_rig_undistorted.7z -odata/
bash demo.sh
```
